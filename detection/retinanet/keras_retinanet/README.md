Directory for code which has been almost directly cloned from https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet.


`util.py` is a combination of chosen functions and layers from throughout the github project listed above. The rest of the files in this folder are largely unchanged, spare for some small modifications, and in some cases, function/modularity pruning.
